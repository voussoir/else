Ideas for later:

Smokescreen pickup: Exclamators cannot detect player. Will wander randomly for 5-10 steps

Hats.

Enemies move faster as the game goes on

Randomized walls in the middle of the arena

Arena walls may be boobytrapped. Running alongside a wall may result in death/stun to disincentivize this tactic

Save game scores in db

Hats.

Sound

Stop using tkinter like a caveman
