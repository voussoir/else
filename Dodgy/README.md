Ideas for later:

Smokescreen pickup: Exclamators cannot detect player. Will wander randomly for 5-10 steps

Gold candy: Special candy which gives quadruple points. Is invisible, flashes every 5 steps, relocates if not found fast enough

Enemies move faster as the game goes on

Randomzied walls in the middle of the arena

Arena walls may be boobytrapped. Running alongside a wall may result in death/stun to disincentivize this tactic

Save game scores in db

Stop using tkinter like a caveman
